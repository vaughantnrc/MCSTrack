This folder contains a set of simulated images in order to help test code.
Each file is named as follows:
C<CAMERA>_F<FRAME>.png

Each camera is 1 meter away from a central pivot point at the origin.
Each camera has its y axis aligned with the world's up direction (+z-axis in Blender).
Cameras 01 through 05 are all oriented 30 degrees relative to the table surface, each increasingly rotated 45 degrees around the world origin.
Cameras 06 through 10 are all oriented 45 degrees relative to the table surface, each increasingly rotated 45 degrees around the world origin
All cameras use the same viewing angle and image resolutions.

Frames from the A and B sets will have the ChArUco board visible to all cameras.
Frames from the C and D sets will have the ChArUco board visible to most cameras but not all.
Frames from the E set are designed to be visible only to specific limited sets of cameras.
